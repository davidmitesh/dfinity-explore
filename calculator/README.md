# Welcome to decenCalc

It is a decentralized calculator built with the Intenet Computer protocol. This project 
currently consists of only three functions i.e addition, multiplication and getting the last result. The implementation of 'Show last result' demonstrates the concept of state persistence in the dfinity canister, as a
result of which databases are not needed. As Sodium Network is still not accessible to general public, so the only option left was to create a local replica of Internet computer subnet in the local development environement.
